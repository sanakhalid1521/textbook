## Practical Exercise Assessment

### Hands-on Exercise Completion
- **Functionality**: Does the implementation work as expected?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured and documented?
- **Problem-solving**: How effectively does the student address challenges?
- **Creativity**: Does the student extend the basic exercise with creative solutions?

## Performance Standards
- **A (90-100%)**: Meets all Exemplary criteria and demonstrates advanced understanding
- **B (80-89%)**: Meets most Proficient criteria with some Exemplary elements
- **C (70-79%)**: Meets most Developing criteria with some Proficient elements
- **D (60-69%)**: Meets Beginning criteria for most objectives
- **F (Below 60%)**: Does not meet Beginning criteria for most objectives

## Feedback Guidelines
