# Feature Specification: RAG Chatbot for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Feature**: 003-rag-chatbot | **Date**: 2025-12-10 | **Branch**: `003-rag-chatbot`

## Overview

Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows users to ask questions about the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook content and receive context-aware answers. The chatbot will use OpenAI's API for natural language processing, Qdrant for vector storage and retrieval, and optionally Cohere for enhanced NLP features.

## User Stories

### US1: User Queries
**As a** learner of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics,
**I want** to ask questions about textbook content in natural language,
**So that** I can get immediate, contextually relevant answers without searching through chapters manually.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can type questions in a chat interface
- [ ] System retrieves relevant textbook content based on the query
- [ ] System generates accurate, context-aware responses
- [ ] Responses include citations to relevant textbook sections

### US2: Context Selection
**As a** learner,
**I want** to select text from the textbook and ask questions about that specific content,
**So that** I can get detailed explanations about specific concepts I'm studying.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can select text on any page
- [ ] User can ask questions about the selected text
- [ ] System prioritizes the selected text in context retrieval
- [ ] Responses are specific to the selected content

### US3: Seamless Integration
**As a** learner,
**I want** to access the chatbot from any page in the textbook,
**So that** I can get help without navigating away from my current lesson.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Floating chat widget is available on all pages
- [ ] Chat widget doesn't interfere with content reading
- [ ] Widget can be minimized/maximized
- [ ] Previous conversation history is preserved

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Query Processing
- System shall accept natural language queries from users
- System shall process queries using OpenAI's language model
- System shall return responses in a conversational format
- System shall handle follow-up questions in context

### FR-002: Content Retrieval
- System shall retrieve relevant textbook content based on user queries
- System shall use vector embeddings for semantic search
- System shall return the most relevant content chunks as context
- System shall prioritize recent textbook sections if context is specified

### FR-003: Vector Database Integration
- System shall store textbook content embeddings in Qdrant Cloud
- System shall perform efficient similarity search on embeddings
- System shall update embeddings when textbook content changes
- System shall handle embedding generation and storage securely

### FR-004: Frontend Integration
- System shall provide a floating chat widget accessible from any page
- System shall maintain conversation history
- System shall allow text selection and context-specific queries
- System shall match the textbook's visual design and branding

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance
- Query responses must be generated within 5 seconds
- Vector search operations must complete within 1 second
- System must handle concurrent users without degradation

### NFR-002: Security
- API keys must be stored securely and not exposed to frontend
- User queries must be sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- System must comply with data privacy regulations

### NFR-003: Usability
- Chat interface must be intuitive and accessible
- Response quality must be high with minimal hallucinations
- System must handle ambiguous queries gracefully

## Success Criteria

### SC-001: Query Accuracy
At least 90% of generated responses are accurate and relevant to the textbook content.

### SC-002: Response Time
Query responses are generated within 5 seconds for 95% of requests.

### SC-003: User Satisfaction
Users find the chatbot helpful for understanding textbook content, with positive feedback rating of 4+ stars.

### SC-004: Integration Quality
Chat widget is seamlessly integrated without impacting textbook navigation or performance.

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must work with existing Docusaurus structure without modifying content
- Must use Qdrant Cloud Free Tier limitations
- Must securely manage API keys
- Must follow hands-on learning principles of the textbook

### Assumptions
