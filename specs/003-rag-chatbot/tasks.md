**Feature**: 003-rag-chatbot | **Date**: 2025-12-10 | **Plan**: [link to plan.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-rag-chatbot/spec.md`

**Note**: This file is filled in by the `/sp.tasks` command. See `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` for the structure.

## Summary

This document breaks down the implementation of the RAG chatbot for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook into executable tasks. The system will use OpenAI for natural language processing, Qdrant for vector storage and retrieval, and Cohere for enhanced NLP features. The implementation includes a FastAPI backend for processing queries and a React-based floating chat widget integrated with Docusaurus.

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: Complete Phase 1 (Backend setup) and Phase 2 (Core RAG functionality) to deliver a functional chatbot that can answer questions about textbook content.

**Delivery Approach**: Backend-first development followed by frontend integration, with content loading scripts for initial data population.

**Parallel Opportunities**: Backend API development and frontend component development can proceed in parallel after foundational setup is complete.

## Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure Setup

Goal: Establish the backend infrastructure for the RAG chatbot with API endpoints, vector database connection, and AI service integrations.

Independent Test: Backend server starts successfully, connects to Qdrant, and OpenAI/Cohere clients are properly initialized.

- [X] T001 Create project structure with backend directories (api, models, services, utils, config)
- [X] T002 Set up FastAPI application with proper routing and middleware
- [X] T003 Implement configuration management with environment variables
- [X] T004 Create data models for queries, documents, and responses
- [X] T005 Set up API routes for chat and document processing
- [X] T006 Add proper error handling and validation
- [X] T007 Create requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
- [X] T008 Create example .env file for API key configuration

## Phase 2: Vector Database and Embedding Integration

Goal: Implement vector database integration with Qdrant and document embedding functionality.

Independent Test: Text content can be embedded and stored in Qdrant, with successful retrieval of similar content.

- [X] T009 Implement Qdrant client with proper configuration
- [X] T010 Create embedding service for OpenAI integration
- [X] T011 Implement text splitting utility for document chunking
- [X] T012 Create document storage functionality in Qdrant
- [X] T013 Implement similarity search functionality
- [X] T014 Add proper error handling for vector operations
- [X] T015 Test embedding generation and storage performance

## Phase 3: Core RAG Implementation

Goal: Implement the core Retrieval-Augmented Generation functionality that combines document retrieval with AI response generation.

Independent Test: User queries are processed to retrieve relevant textbook content and generate contextually appropriate responses.

- [X] T016 Create RAG service to orchestrate retrieval and generation
- [X] T017 Implement query processing pipeline
- [X] T018 Integrate OpenAI for response generation
- [X] T019 Add context preparation and formatting
- [X] T020 Implement source attribution and citations
- [X] T021 Add conversation history management
- [X] T022 Test end-to-end query processing flow

## Phase 4: Frontend Chat Widget

Goal: Create a user-friendly chat interface that integrates seamlessly with the Docusaurus textbook site.

Independent Test: Chat widget appears on all pages, allows user queries, and displays responses with source information.

- [X] T023 Create React-based chat widget component
- [X] T024 Implement chat window UI with message display
- [X] T025 Create individual message components with source display
- [X] T026 Add CSS styling matching the textbook's design
- [X] T027 Implement text selection and context features
- [X] T028 Add responsive design for mobile compatibility
- [X] T029 Integrate with backend API for real-time communication

## Phase 5: Cohere Integration

Goal: Enhance the RAG system with Cohere's NLP capabilities for improved results.

Independent Test: Cohere services are properly integrated and provide enhanced functionality like result reranking and summarization.

- [X] T030 Implement Cohere service client
- [X] T031 Add Cohere embedding functionality as alternative
- [X] T032 Integrate result reranking using Cohere
- [X] T033 Add text summarization for long responses
- [X] T034 Implement fallback mechanisms when Cohere is unavailable
- [X] T035 Test Cohere-enhanced features performance

## Phase 6: Content Processing and Deployment

Goal: Create tools and processes to load textbook content into the vector database and prepare for deployment.

Independent Test: Textbook content is successfully loaded into the vector database and available for retrieval.

- [X] T036 Create script to load MDX textbook content
- [X] T037 Implement metadata extraction from file paths
- [X] T038 Add content parsing to handle MDX format
- [X] T039 Test content loading performance and accuracy
- [X] T040 Create deployment configuration files
- [X] T041 Document setup and deployment procedures
- [X] T042 Validate content integrity after loading

## Dependencies

- Configuration (T003) must be set up before API endpoints (T005)
- Vector database integration (Phase 2) must be complete before RAG implementation (Phase 3)
- Backend API (Phase 1-3) must be ready before frontend integration (Phase 4)
- OpenAI integration (T018) must be working before RAG service (T016)

## Parallel Execution Examples

- T024-T026: UI components can be developed in parallel
- T031-T034: Cohere features can be developed in parallel
- T037-T039: Content processing tasks can be developed in parallel

## Success Criteria Verification

- [X] SC-001: Query responses are accurate and relevant to textbook content
- [X] SC-002: Query responses are generated within 5 seconds for 95% of requests
- [X] SC-003: Users find the chatbot helpful for understanding textbook content
- [X] SC-004: Chat widget is seamlessly integrated without impacting textbook navigation
- [X] SC-005: Chatbot works without modifying existing chapter and lesson content structure
- [X] SC-006: Backend API endpoints are properly implemented and accessible
- [X] SC-007: Frontend ChatWidget successfully communicates with backend services
