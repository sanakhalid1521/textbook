# Implementation Tasks: User Authentication System

**Feature**: 002-authentication | **Date**: 2025-12-10 | **Plan**: [link to plan.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-authentication/spec.md`

**Note**: This file is filled in by the `/sp.tasks` command. See `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` for the structure.

## Summary

This document breaks down the implementation of the user authentication system into executable tasks. The system will include secure user registration, login functionality, and session management. The implementation will use Node.js/Express for the backend API with bcrypt for password hashing, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management, and a database to store user information.

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: Complete Phase 1 (Backend setup) and Phase 2 (Authentication endpoints) to deliver a functional authentication system with sign up and login capabilities.

**Delivery Approach**: Incremental delivery with backend API first, followed by frontend components, and finally integration with the Docusaurus textbook site.

**Parallel Opportunities**: Backend and frontend development can proceed in parallel after foundational setup is complete.

## Phase 1: Backend Setup and Configuration

Goal: Establish the backend infrastructure for authentication with database connection, user model, and security utilities.

Independent Test: Backend server starts successfully, connects to database, and authentication endpoints are available.

- [X] T001 Create project structure with authentication directories (api/models, api/routes, api/middleware, api/utils)
- [X] T002 Set up User model with email, password, displayName, and timestamps
- [X] T003 Implement password hashing utility with bcrypt
- [X] T004 Create authentication middleware for token verification
- [X] T005 Set up MongoDB connection with Mongoose
- [X] T006 Add environment configuration with dotenv

## Phase 2: Authentication API Endpoints

Goal: Implement secure sign up and login endpoints with proper validation and error handling.

Independent Test: API endpoints accept valid credentials and return appropriate responses with JWT tokens.

- [X] T007 [P] Create sign up endpoint with email and password validation
- [X] T008 [P] Create login endpoint with credential verification
- [X] T009 [P] Implement JWT token generation and validation
- [X] T010 [P] Add proper error handling and validation messages
- [X] T011 [P] Implement logout endpoint
- [X] T012 [P] Add user input sanitization and security measures

## Phase 3: Frontend Authentication Components

Goal: Create React components for sign up and login forms with proper state management and user experience.

Independent Test: Users can interact with sign up and login forms, submit data, and receive appropriate feedback.

- [X] T013 Create authentication context with React hooks
- [X] T014 Create sign up form component with validation
- [X] T015 Create login form component with validation
- [X] T016 Implement authentication state management
- [X] T017 Create authentication wrapper component
- [X] T018 Add proper styling for authentication components

## Phase 4: Docusaurus Integration

Goal: Integrate the authentication system with the Docusaurus textbook site, including navigation updates and protected content.

Independent Test: Authentication components are accessible from the Docusaurus site, and user state persists across page navigation.

- [X] T019 Create custom Layout wrapper to provide auth context to entire app
- [X] T020 Add login and signup pages to Docusaurus routing
- [X] T021 Update navbar with login/signup links
- [X] T022 Create authentication status component for navbar
- [X] T023 Add CSS styling for authentication components
- [X] T024 Test authentication flow across Docusaurus pages

## Phase 5: Testing and Validation

Goal: Verify that all authentication functionality works as expected and meets security requirements.

Independent Test: All authentication flows work correctly, security measures are in place, and user data is properly protected.

- [X] T025 Test sign up flow with valid and invalid inputs
- [X] T026 Test login flow with valid and invalid credentials
- [X] T027 Verify JWT token generation and validation
- [X] T028 Test password hashing and verification
- [X] T029 Verify user session persistence
- [X] T030 Test logout functionality
- [X] T031 Validate security measures and error handling

## Phase 6: Google OAuth Integration

Goal: Add Google OAuth functionality to allow users to sign up and log in with their Google accounts.

Independent Test: Users can successfully authenticate using their Google accounts and the system properly creates or links user accounts.

- [X] T032 Add Google OAuth dependencies and configuration
- [X] T033 Implement Google OAuth strategy with Passport
- [X] T034 Create Google OAuth routes for login and callback
- [X] T035 Update frontend components with Google login button
- [X] T036 Handle OAuth callback response and token storage
- [X] T037 Integrate Google OAuth with existing auth context
- [X] T038 Test Google OAuth functionality with real Google account

## Dependencies

- User model (T002) must be created before authentication endpoints (T007-T012)
- Backend setup (Phase 1) must be completed before API endpoints (Phase 2)
- API endpoints must be available before frontend components (Phase 3)
- Frontend components must be ready before Docusaurus integration (Phase 4)

## Parallel Execution Examples

- T007-T012: All authentication endpoints can be developed in parallel
- T014-T015: Sign up and login forms can be developed in parallel
- T025-T030: Various tests can be executed in parallel

## Success Criteria Verification

- [X] SC-001: Registration functionality works with proper validation
- [X] SC-002: Authentication succeeds with valid credentials
- [X] SC-003: Security requirements are implemented
- [X] SC-004: User experience is clear and intuitive
- [X] SC-005: Google OAuth functionality allows users to sign up and log in with Google accounts
