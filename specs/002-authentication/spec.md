# Feature Specification: User Authentication System

**Feature**: 002-authentication | **Date**: 2025-12-10 | **Branch**: `002-authentication`

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive user authentication system that includes sign up and login functionality for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This feature will allow users to create accounts, log in securely, and access personalized content or track their learning progress.

## User Stories

### US1: User Registration
**As a** new user of the textbook,
**I want** to create an account with a sign up form,
**So that** I can access personalized features and track my learning progress.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can enter email, password, and optional display name
- [ ] Password must meet minimum security requirements (8+ characters, mix of letters/numbers)
- [ ] System validates email format and uniqueness
- [ ] User receives confirmation of successful registration
- [ ] System prevents duplicate email registration

### US2: User Login
**As a** registered user of the textbook,
**I want** to log in with my credentials,
**So that** I can access my personalized learning dashboard and saved progress.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can enter email and password to log in
- [ ] System validates credentials securely
- [ ] Successful login redirects to user dashboard or previous location
- [ ] Failed login shows appropriate error message
- [ ] System prevents brute force attempts

### US3: User Session Management
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** my session to be maintained during my visit,
**So that** I don't have to repeatedly log in while using the textbook.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User remains logged in across page navigation
- [ ] Session expires after defined period of inactivity
- [ ] User can securely log out
- [ ] Session is properly cleared on logout

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: User Registration
- System shall provide a sign up form with fields for email, password, and optional display name
- System shall validate email format using standard email validation rules
- System shall enforce password strength requirements (minimum 8 characters, mix of letters and numbers)
- System shall check for duplicate email addresses before registration
- System shall securely store user credentials using appropriate hashing mechanisms

### FR-002: User Authentication
- System shall authenticate users using email and password credentials
- System shall implement secure password verification using hashing
- System shall provide appropriate feedback for authentication failures
- System shall implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

### FR-003: Session Management
- System shall maintain user sessions using secure session tokens
- System shall implement automatic session expiration after 30 minutes of inactivity
- System shall provide secure logout functionality
- System shall clear all session data upon logout

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Security
- Passwords must be stored using bcrypt or similar secure hashing algorithm
- Session tokens must be cryptographically secure
- Authentication endpoints must implement rate limiting
- All authentication communications must be encrypted (HTTPS)

### NFR-002: Performance
- Login operations must complete within 2 seconds
- Registration operations must complete within 3 seconds
- Session validation must complete within 100ms

### NFR-003: Usability
- Sign up form must be accessible and responsive
- Clear error messages must be provided for validation failures
- Password requirements must be clearly communicated

## Success Criteria

### SC-001: Registration Success Rate
At least 95% of registration attempts result in successful account creation when valid information is provided.

### SC-002: Authentication Success Rate
At least 98% of authentication attempts succeed when valid credentials are provided.

### SC-003: Security Compliance
All security requirements are implemented and validated to prevent common authentication vulnerabilities.

### SC-004: User Experience
Users can complete registration and login processes without confusion, with clear feedback at each step.

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Authentication system must integrate with existing Docusaurus-based textbook
- No external authentication providers (OAuth) required initially
- No password reset functionality required in this release
- No account verification via email required in this release

### Assumptions
- User data will be stored in a local database
- The system will be deployed with SSL/HTTPS
- Users have JavaScript enabled in their browsers
- The textbook will be hosted on a server capable of running authentication services
