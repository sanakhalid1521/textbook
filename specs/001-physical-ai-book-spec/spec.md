**Feature Branch**: `001-physical-ai-book-spec`
**Created**: 2025-12-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create detailed specification for Physical AI book with 5 chapters, 3 lessons each, context guidelines, lesson format, and Docusaurus-specific requirements"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Student Learns Physical AI Fundamentals (Priority: P1)

A beginner student accesses the first chapter of the Physical AI textbook to learn basic concepts of AI and robotics integration. They follow hands-on lessons with practical examples and exercises that guide them through setting up simulation environments and basic robot control.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the entire learning experience and must be completed to provide any value to the user.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a student with no prior experience complete the first chapter's lessons and successfully execute basic robot control commands in simulation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student with basic programming knowledge, **When** they complete Chapter 1 lessons, **Then** they can explain fundamental concepts of Physical AI and execute basic robot commands
2. **Given** a student following the hands-on exercises, **When** they complete the chapter projects, **Then** they can demonstrate understanding through practical implementation

### User Story 2 - Student Progresses Through Advanced Topics (Priority: P2)

An intermediate student accesses advanced chapters to learn complex AI algorithms for humanoid robotics, including perception, decision-making, and actuation systems. They work through increasingly complex projects that build on previous knowledge.

**Why this priority**: This provides the advanced learning content that differentiates the textbook and provides comprehensive coverage of the subject.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a student complete advanced chapter exercises and successfully implement complex AI behaviors in humanoid robots.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student who has completed earlier chapters, **When** they work through advanced topics, **Then** they can implement sophisticated AI algorithms for robot behavior

### User Story 3 - Educator Uses Textbook for Course Delivery (Priority: P3)

An educator uses the textbook as a course resource, leveraging the structured content, hands-on exercises, and Docusaurus-based documentation to deliver lessons to students in a classroom or online environment.

**Why this priority**: This expands the textbook's utility beyond individual learners to educational institutions.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having an educator successfully use the textbook content to deliver a course module with measurable learning outcomes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an educator accessing the textbook, **When** they use the content for course delivery, **Then** they can guide students through structured learning experiences with clear objectives and outcomes

### Edge Cases

- What happens when students have different levels of hardware access for hands-on exercises?
- How does the system handle students with different programming backgrounds and skill levels?
- What if students cannot access recommended simulation environments due to system requirements?
- How are accessibility requirements handled for students with disabilities?
