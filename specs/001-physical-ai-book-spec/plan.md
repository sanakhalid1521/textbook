# Implementation Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Branch**: `001-physical-ai-book-spec` | **Date**: 2025-12-09 | **Spec**: [link to spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-physical-ai-book-spec/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Development of a comprehensive Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook using Docusaurus v3+ framework. The textbook will include 5 chapters with 3 lessons each, following a hands-on learning approach as mandated by the project constitution. The implementation will focus on Docusaurus setup with proper navigation, search functionality, mathematical notation support, and interactive content to support the learning objectives.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3+ for Docusaurus configuration, Python 3.8+ for robotics examples, JavaScript/MDX for content
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus v3+, React, MathJax, Mermaid, Algolia for search
**Storage**: Static files in docs/ directory, no database required
**Testing**: Jest for any custom components, manual testing for content accuracy
**Target Platform**: Web-based, responsive design for desktop and mobile
**Project Type**: Static site documentation
**Performance Goals**: Fast loading times, <3s initial load, responsive interactions
**Constraints**: Must support mathematical notation, code examples, diagrams, and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
**Scale/Scope**: 5 chapters, 15 lessons, supporting exercises and examples

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1. **Hands-On Learning First**: ✓ Will include hands-on exercises and practical examples in each lesson
2. **Beginner-to-Intermediate Accessibility**: ✓ Content structured with clear prerequisites and progressive complexity
3. **Docusaurus Documentation Excellence**: ✓ Following Docusaurus best practices for navigation, search, responsive design
4. **Practical AI & Robotics Integration**: ✓ Focus on intersection of AI and physical systems as required
5. **Reproducible Learning Experiences**: ✓ All examples will include setup instructions and expected outcomes
6. **Safety and Ethics by Design**: ✓ Safety considerations and ethics integrated into content

## Development Phases

### Phase 0: Setup and Configuration
- Docusaurus installation and configuration
- Theme customization to match educational requirements
- Navigation setup for 5 chapters and 15 lessons
- Search and accessibility configuration
- Mathematical notation and diagram support

### Phase 1: Content Framework Development
- Create standardized lesson template
- Implement MDX components for interactive elements
- Set up code example display system
- Create exercise and verification components
- Implement cross-linking between concepts

### Phase 2: Content Creation
- Develop Chapter 1 content (Introduction to Physical AI)
- Develop Chapter 2 content (Perception Systems)
- Develop Chapter 3 content (Decision Making and Control)
- Develop Chapter 4 content (AI Integration and Intelligence)
- Develop Chapter 5 content (Advanced Applications and Integration)

**Structure Decision**: Standard Docusaurus documentation structure was selected as it best supports the hierarchical organization required for textbook content, with clear navigation between chapters and lessons. This structure enables search functionality, responsive design, and proper cross-linking between related concepts as required by the constitution.

## Docusaurus Setup Steps and Configuration

### Initial Setup
1. Install Docusaurus: `npx create-docusaurus@latest textbook-physical-ai classic`
2. Configure TypeScript support in `docusaurus.config.ts`
3. Set up proper navigation for 5 chapters and 15 lessons in `sidebars.ts`
4. Configure Algolia search with appropriate settings

### Required Plugins and Features
1. **MathJax Plugin**: For mathematical notation support
2. **Mermaid Plugin**: For diagram generation
3. **Code Block Enhancements**: For multiple language support
4. **Custom MDX Components**: For interactive exercises and examples

### File Structure for Chapters and Lessons
- Each chapter will be a directory under `docs/chapters/`
- Each lesson will be an MDX file within its chapter directory
- Exercises will be organized in `docs/exercises/` by chapter
- Code examples will be in `docs/code-examples/` by chapter
- Assets like diagrams and images will be in `docs/assets/`
