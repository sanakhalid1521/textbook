**Feature**: 001-physical-ai-book-spec | **Date**: 2025-12-09 | **Plan**: [link to plan.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-physical-ai-book-spec/spec.md`

**Note**: This file is filled in by the `/sp.tasks` command. See `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` for the structure.

## Summary

This document breaks down the implementation of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook into executable tasks. The project includes Docusaurus setup and configuration, followed by content creation for 5 chapters with 3 lessons each, totaling 15 lessons. Each task follows a checklist format with sequential IDs, parallelization markers where applicable, and user story labels for traceability.
