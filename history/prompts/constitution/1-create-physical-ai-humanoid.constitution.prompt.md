## Prompt

I am writing a text book for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics  with these requirment  target audience beginner to intermiate tach stack: docusaurus documentation focus on handon

focus on handson learning provide the constitution with vision, core principle, sucess critearea, constraints and brand voice

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook with the following key elements:

- Vision: To create an accessible, hands-on learning resource that empowers beginners to intermediate learners to understand, build, and experiment with physical AI and humanoid robotics systems through practical, project-based education.

- Core Principles:
  1. Hands-On Learning First: Learning through doing is the foundation
  2. Beginner-to-Intermediate Accessibility: Content structured for all levels
  3. Docusaurus Documentation Excellence: Following best practices
  4. Practical AI & Robotics Integration: Focusing on AI-hardware intersection
  5. Reproducible Learning Experiences: All examples must be reproducible
  6. Safety and Ethics by Design: Including safety and ethics from the start

- Technical Constraints: Specifying Docusaurus, Python/C++, accessible hardware, etc.
- Development Workflow: Content creation process and quality gates
- Governance: How the constitution is maintained

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created foundational constitution document for the textbook project
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with comprehensive constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with textbook content creation
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution addresses all requirements including target audience, tech stack, and hands-on focus

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin creating textbook content following the constitution
