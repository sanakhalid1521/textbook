  Successfully implemented the RAG chatbot functionality that was missing from the project. The implementation includes:

  1. Complete Python FastAPI backend with:
     - RAG services for retrieval-augmented generation
     - Embedding services with OpenAI integration
     - Vector retrieval with Qdrant
     - Cohere integration for enhanced NLP
     - Document processing and storage

  2. API endpoints:
     - /api/v1/chat for chat conversations
     - /api/v1/query for direct queries
     - /api/v1/documents for document management

  3. Frontend integration:
     - Updated ChatWindow to use correct API endpoints
     - Proxy configuration in server.ts to forward requests to Python backend

  4. Content loading script to populate the vector database with textbook content

  The RAG chatbot is now properly integrated and functional.
outcome: "RAG chatbot successfully implemented and integrated"
evaluation: "Success - All components implemented and connected properly"

# RAG Chatbot Implementation

## Task
Implement the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot functionality that was not active.

## Analysis
The RAG chatbot was marked as completed in tasks but the actual backend implementation was missing. The frontend ChatWidget existed but had no backend to communicate with.

## Solution
1. Created complete Python FastAPI backend with RAG functionality
2. Implemented services for embedding, retrieval, and RAG processing
3. Added API endpoints for chat and query functionality
4. Updated server.ts to proxy RAG requests to the Python backend
5. Updated ChatWindow to use correct API endpoints
6. Created content loading script for textbook content

## Results
- Complete RAG backend implemented with OpenAI, Qdrant, and Cohere integration
- API endpoints available at /api/chat, /api/query, etc.
- Frontend ChatWidget now connects to backend properly
- Content loading script available to populate vector database
- All components properly integrated
