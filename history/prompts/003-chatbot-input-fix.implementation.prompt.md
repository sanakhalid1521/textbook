  Fixed the chatbot input issue by:

  1. Enhanced error handling in ChatWindow.tsx to properly manage API connection failures
  2. Added request timeout mechanism to prevent hanging requests
  3. Improved error messages to inform users when backend is unavailable
  4. Created startup scripts (start-backend.bat and start-backend.sh) to easily start the Python backend
  5. Updated README with clear instructions on running both frontend and backend services

  The issue was that the Python FastAPI backend was not running, causing API requests to fail and making the chatbot appear unresponsive. The fixes ensure the UI remains responsive even when backend is unavailable and provide clear guidance on starting the required services.
outcome: "Chatbot input functionality restored"
evaluation: "Success - Chatbot now properly handles backend unavailability and provides clear user feedback"

# Chatbot Input Fix

## Task
Fix the issue where the chatbot is not accepting input ("chatbot ka input hi nhi le raha he").

## Analysis
The issue was that the Python backend service was not running, causing API requests to fail. This made the chatbot appear unresponsive to user input. The frontend was not properly handling API connection failures, which could make the UI appear frozen.

## Solution
1. Enhanced error handling in ChatWindow.tsx with better error detection and user feedback
2. Added request timeout mechanism to prevent hanging API calls
3. Created convenient startup scripts for the Python backend service
4. Updated documentation with clear instructions for running both services

## Results
- Chatbot input field now remains responsive even when backend is unavailable
- Users receive clear error messages when backend is not accessible
- Easy startup scripts provided to run the Python backend service
- Improved troubleshooting documentation
