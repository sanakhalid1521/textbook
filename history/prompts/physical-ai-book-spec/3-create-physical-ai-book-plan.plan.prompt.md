## Prompt

create a development planfor building these book in docusaurus include: docusaurus setup steps and configration, context development phases, file structure for the chapter and lesson

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook including:

- Technical context with technology stack (Docusaurus v3+, TypeScript, Python)
- Constitution check confirming alignment with all core principles
- Development phases (Setup, Content Framework, Content Creation)
- Detailed project structure with file organization for 5 chapters and 15 lessons
- Docusaurus setup steps and configuration requirements
- Research document with technology decisions
- Data model for content entities (Chapter, Lesson, Exercise, etc.)
- Quickstart guide for setting up the textbook

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete implementation plan aligned with constitution principles
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to task creation with /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan addresses all requirements including Docusaurus setup, development phases, and file structure

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin task creation for implementation
