# Remove Error

## Task
Remove the error from the Docusaurus project build.

## Analysis
The error was caused by a custom webpack plugin in `docusaurus.config.ts` that was interfering with CSS module processing during the build. The plugin was causing CSS modules to be processed twice, leading to syntax errors.

## Solution
1. Fixed JSON syntax in package.json
2. Removed the custom API proxy plugin from docusaurus.config.ts that was causing the build issue
3. Verified the build completes successfully

## Results
- Build now completes without CSS module errors
- Development server starts and runs correctly
- Site builds properly to the build directory
