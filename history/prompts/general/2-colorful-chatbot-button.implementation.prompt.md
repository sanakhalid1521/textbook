# Colorful Chatbot Button

## PROMPT_TEXT

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Updated the chat widget button to make it more colorful and visible with a vibrant magenta-purple-pink theme that matches the textbook's design. The button now features:

1. A beautiful gradient from magenta (#DB2777) to purple (#BE185D) to deeper purple (#9D174D)
2. A subtle pulse animation to draw attention
3. A light pink gradient badge with dark magenta text
4. Enhanced hover effects with scaling and darker gradient
5. Matching magenta-colored shadows

The button is now much more visually prominent and colorful while maintaining consistency with the textbook's light magenta theme. It will be clearly visible on the bottom right of every page with its vibrant colors and subtle animation.

## OUTCOME

Chatbot button is now colorful with magenta-purple-pink gradient and enhanced visibility.
