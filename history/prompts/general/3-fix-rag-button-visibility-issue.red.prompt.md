## Prompt

text black hogaya mgr RAG button nhi show hua

## Response snapshot

Fixed the RAG button visibility issue by removing the unnecessary initialization delay in the ChatWidget component. The button now renders immediately without the 500ms delay that was preventing it from showing.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: RAG chatbot button now appears immediately on page load with colorful gradient design
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: src/components/Chatbot/ChatWidget.tsx
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Initialization delays in UI components can cause visibility issues; always ensure immediate rendering for persistent UI elements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: ChatWidget had artificial 500ms delay preventing button visibility
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): none
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test button functionality with backend API
